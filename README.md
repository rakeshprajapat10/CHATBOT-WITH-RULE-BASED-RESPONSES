How AI Chatbots Work
Input Processing:

When a user types a message, the chatbot receives this input. It first processes the text to understand what the user is saying.
Understanding Intent:

The chatbot analyzes the input to determine the user's intent. This can be done using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, which help the bot understand the meaning behind the words.
Response Generation:

Once the intent is understood, the chatbot generates a response. This can be:
Rule-Based: Predefined responses based on keywords or phrases (e.g., if the user says "hello," the bot replies with "Hi there!").
AI-Based: Using machine learning models to create more dynamic responses based on context and past interactions.
Sending the Response:

The chatbot sends the generated response back to the user. This could be in a chat window, on a website, or through messaging apps.
Learning and Improvement:

Some chatbots can learn from interactions over time, improving their responses based on user feedback and new data.
Example Interaction
User: "What's the weather like today?"
Chatbot: "Today’s weather is sunny with a high of 75°F.
